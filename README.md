## ✨ Key Features (What It Hides)

Focus on the stream, not the noise. CleanTwitch removes the following elements:

* **Monetization & Promos**: "Get Bits," "Cheer," "Gift Turbo," "Go Ad-Free for Free" buttons, Hype Train, and large promotional banners (e.g., SUBtember, Gift Expiration).
* **Navigation & Discovery**: Stories, "Upcoming Streams" panels, "show more" separators, and unnecessary sidebar headers/titles.
* **Stream Info Clutter**: Subscriber goals, "Share" buttons on the player, and user card "Whisper" buttons.
* **Chat**: "New Item Indicator" for Bits/Gifts. *Optional rules are available to hide leaderboards and pinned messages.*
* **Visual Polish**: Removes search bar borders/shadows and makes the 'About' panel background transparent.
* **Enhanced Statistics**: Unifies and centers the Viewer Count and Uptime display, specifically styling elements for a **clean FrankerFaceZ (FFZ)** metadata tray.
